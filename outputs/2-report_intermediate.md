Introduction  
Project Background:   
Tatva was engaged to perform API Assessment for VERAH. This assessment utilized tools and techniques analogous to those employed by malicious 
attackers, focusing on evaluating the security of VERAH’s API infrastructure in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The primary objective 
was to uncover both technical and logical vulnerabilities within APIs and to provide strategic recommendations for mitigating risks that could arise 
from these vulnerabilities.  
Objective:  
Conduct comprehensive API assessment to identify and assess vulnerabilities in API’s, thereby enhancing VERAH’s security posture and effectively 
protecting against external threats.  
Assumptions:   
Based on the scope, only the specified APIs were tested. This report has been produced based on the test that was conducted on a particular date 
tested. Vulnerability details provided in this report are based on the API’s provided for assessment considering test was performed on a production 
or identical to production environment.  
It is recommended that prior to acting on the recommendations, following actions are assumed to be taken by VERAH:  
• 
Any vulnerabilities identified after the assessment date may also not form part of this report.  
• 
GT provided the reference link in the detailed vulnerability section for VERAH reference only.   
• 
Any fix to application/system should be tested on UAT or non-production environment prior to any patch deployment on production 
environment.   
• 
Appropriate backup and rollback plan are made prior to implementing the recommendation on the system.  
• 
This report is intended solely for the information and internal use of VERAH.  
• 
VERAH’s team is responsible for applying security fixes and maintaining effective security controls on application, network, and system.  
Engagement Scope  
Below details of assets covered in the scope are included in this section along with other relevant details.

Detailed Observations   
The details of identified vulnerabilities, impact, severity, and recommendations for the same are explained below  
1. Broken Access Control  
Status: Open  
Severity: High  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that the PATCH token management API and the user details API do not implement authentication or authorization checks. The 
endpoints allow token state modifications such as suspend and activate, and also return sensitive user information including token status and 
card URI details, without any authentication checks.  
Impact:  
An attacker can exploit these API endpoints to perform unauthorized token state changes and access sensitive user data. This may lead to 
exposure of confidential information, unauthorized account modifications, and potential misuse of sensitive resources, resulting in security and 
privacy risks.

Recommendation:   
  
It is recommended to:   
  
• 
Enforce authentication checks across all API endpoints to ensure only legitimate users can access them.  
• 
Implement strict authorization controls for sensitive operations such as token management to restrict access based on user roles and 
privileges. Apply object-level access control to ensure users can only interact with their own data. Ensure sensitive information is only 
returned after proper authentication validation.

2. No Rate Limiting  
Status: Open Severity: 
Medium  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that the API endpoint protected by an authorization header requiring a one-time password (OTP) does not enforce any rate 
limiting, allowing an attacker to continuously send a high number of requests without any restriction, delay, or blocking mechanism.  
Impact:  
A malicious actor can repeatedly send unauthorized or automated requests to brute-force OTP values or flood the endpoint, increasing the risk 
of unauthorized access, abuse of authentication mechanisms, and potential service degradation or denial of service for legitimate users.

3. OTP Misconfiguration  
Status: Open Severity: 
Medium  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that the application accepts an OTP value through the Authorization header but does not perform any validation of this value, 
allowing any arbitrary OTP to be treated as valid for authorization.  
Impact:  
A malicious actor can supply any random OTP in the Authorization header to bypass authentication controls and gain unauthorized access to 
protected endpoints and functionality.  
CVE/CWE:  
CWE‑287: Improper Authentication  
Affected Asset:   
 
•  
https://in-Tatva-tr.stg.VERAHpay.ca/pf/vl/tokens  
Recommendation:   
  
It is recommended to validate the OTP supplied in the Authorization header by matching it against a generated OTP tied to the user or request, 
enforcing expiration and rejecting invalid or reused values.

4. Sensitive Information Disclosure  
Status: Open Severity: 
Medium  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that an API responds with sensitive certificate data, including NPCI certificates and device root certificates, when all security 
headers are removed and the server ID parameter is tampered with, indicating that access controls and response filtering are not properly 
enforced.  
Impact:  
A malicious actor can extract internal certificate information by manipulating request headers or parameters, which may aid in further attacks 
such as environment fingerprinting, trust chain analysis, or crafting more targeted exploitation attempts.  
CVE/CWE:  
CWE‑200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor  
Affected Asset:   
 
•  
https://in-Tatva-tr.stg.VERAHpay.ca/pf/vl/enrollments/  
Recommendation:   
  
It is recommended to restrict API responses to authorized and valid requests only by enforcing strict header validation, validating server 
identifiers, and ensuring sensitive certificates or internal configuration data are never exposed in API responses.

5. Insecure Direct Object Reference  
Status: Open Severity: 
Medium  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that the application allows access to card details by using MID and DMID parameters that differ for each device. However, by 
modifying the MID and DMID values to those of other devices, the user was still able to access card details within the same session, indicating 
improper authorization checks on these parameters.

Impact:  
The attacker only needs a static card URI to access and view sensitive card data within their active session, without requiring further 
authorization. This can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive financial information, resulting in data breaches, fraud, and compliance 
violations.  
CVE/CWE:  
CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key  
Affected Asset:   
 
•  
https://in-Tatva-tr.stg.VERAHpay.ca/pf/vl/resource/*  
Recommendation:   
  
It is recommended to: Implement strict server-side authorization checks to ensure that MID and DMID values are properly mapped to the 
authenticated user session. Validate that users can only access resources explicitly assigned to them. Avoid relying solely on client-supplied 
identifiers for access control. Use indirect references or token-based validation to securely fetch card details.

6. Improper Error Handling  
Status: Open  
Severity: Low  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that when API endpoints are tampered with, the application responds with an HTTP 400 error that discloses detailed exception 
stack traces, and in cases where a duplicate entry is submitted, the API returns an HTTP 500 internal server error revealing database-related 
details such as table or column headers, which exposes internal implementation information to the user.  
Impact:

<!-- PAGE_END: 23 -->

<!-- PAGE_START: 24 -->
## Page 24

### Page Text Content
A malicious actor can leverage the exposed stack traces, database table names, and internal error details to gain insight into the application’s 
backend logic, database structure, and technologies in use, which can significantly aid in crafting targeted attacks such as SQL injection, privilege 
escalation, or further exploitation of the application.  
CVE/CWE:  
• 
CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message  
• 
CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor  
Affected Asset:   
• 
https://in-Tatva-tr.stg.VERAHpay.ca/*  
Recommendation:   
  
It is recommended to implement proper error handling by returning generic and user-friendly error messages for all API responses, while 
logging detailed error information securely on the server side, and ensuring that exception stack traces, database details, and internal system 
information are never exposed to end users.

7. Banner Grabbing  
Status: Open  
Severity: Low  
Detailed Observation:   
It was observed that by tampering with the API endpoint, the server returns an  error page that discloses internal details such as  Apache and 
its version. This unnecessary exposure allows attackers to fingerprint the technology stack.

Appendices  
   
Risk Rating Criteria   
  
The risk rating is used to signify the level of risk due to gaps noted during the audit and is based on a qualitative criterion defined as follows:   
 
Severity Rating  
Critical  
Critical risk vulnerability has a high potential of impacting business operations leading to downtime or disruption and 
provides an attacker with privileged access, resulting in significant outage. If exploited, it has a direct impact on 
confidentiality, integrity or availability of organizational information.   
High  
High risk vulnerability indicates that successful exploitation of vulnerability may result in a significant impact to the 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information accessible through the application/system or even the backend 
resources like databases, operating systems, etc.    
Medium  
Medium risk vulnerability reveals information about the application and its underlying infrastructure that can be used by 
an attacker in conjunction with another vulnerability to gain privileged control of the application or its underlying operating 
system.   
Low  
Low risk vulnerability has the potential of revealing information about the system and may lead to unauthorized access to 
a system, leading to compromise. Higher work factors would be involved for exploiting this type of vulnerability.   
   
   
To capture the risk rating, the following risk assessment matrix is used considering Impact and probability of risk in terms of ease of exploitation.
